--- v1.1 (18 Apr 2007)
- Changed report descriptor. There are now four separate report IDs, one
per controller. This was necessary because even though all axis and buttons
were perfectly functional in 'control panel -> game controllers', it was not
the case in many games, including zsnes and snes9x!
- Changed device id to 0x0A9D

--- v1.0 (24 Mar 2007)
Initial release.
