--- v1.4 (Dec 3, 2006)
	- Added support for Atari style joysticks. Two button
	  variations (SMS) are supported.
	- Added padding to nes report descriptor. This makes it
	  work correcly on windows. Linux sure is tolerant...

--- v1.3 (Oct 28, 2006)
	- Fixed a bug in nes.c, snes.c and snesmouse.c which prevented the pullup
		on the data pin (from device) from being enabled. This resulted in
		random button toggling when no controller was connected.
	- A separate USB PID is used when in NES mode.
	- PD1 is now left as input (no pullup) since it is shorted with PD0 on the
	  PCB rev.C. (And I didnt want to scrap a batch of 50 pcb nor cut a track
	  and solder a wire 50 times...)

--- v1.2 (Oct 6, 2006)
Added serial number
Added support for Snes mouse (auto detected in snes mode)
	- Default speed: Low
	- 3 Speeds selectable by holding some buttons at
	  startup (USB connect or mouse connect)
	  Left+right buttons: Low speed
	  Left buton: Medium speed
	  Right button: High speed
	  No button: Default speed when USB connect,
	  			continue using same speed for mouse (re)-connect
